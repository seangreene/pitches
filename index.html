	<h2>Fire Season</h2>
	
	<p>As part of my master's thesis, I would like to create a D3 visualization charting the beginning of fire season over the past 50 years. In general, fire season has started sooner each year and has gone on longer, says Tony Westerling, a climate change and wildfire expert at UC Merced. The trend correlates with years of warm springs and early snow melts, Westerling says.</p>
